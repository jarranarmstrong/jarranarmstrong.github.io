		<p>Jarran Ahaz Armstrong is a multi-instrumentalist musician and composer from Church Hill, Tennessee. Known for his chill instrumentals, soothing vocals, and dream-like lyricism, he manages to create a unique and gripping listening experience with every release, blending influences of Hip-Hop, R&B, Blues, Classical, Metal, Rock, Jazz, and EDM (to name a few).</p>

		<p>In 2016, he began releasing music independently through SoundCloud with his first single <strong>Praises</strong>, where he gained the attention of his classmates and others throughout his town. Following this release were other tracks with similar styles such as <strong>Mixed Emotions</strong>, <strong>Southern Classic</strong>, <strong>Wait</strong>, and <strong>Mic Skills</strong>.</p> <p>As Jarran moved on to releasing music to major streaming services, his sound changed as well. Marking this was the release of <strong>Cold Thoughts In An Open Mind</strong>, a bare-bones acoustic guitar song with inspiration coming more from artists like Elliott Smith than his usual hip-hop roots. Releases that followed this development (such as <strong>Felt Tongues</strong>, <strong>Bend To Your Will</strong>, <strong>Life Is Fine!</strong>, and <strong>Caslenia</strong>)  would do more to cement the sound that he is commonly associated with.</p> <p>In addition to his independently produced singles, Jarran composes choral music regularly, which is often programmed and performed by his school's concert choir.  He has been a part of several regional and state level choral events as well as local choir festivals with his his high school choir.</p>
