		<p>Jarran Ahaz Armstrong is armed with nothing but his musical talent. Luckily for him, it seems he possesses it in spades<p>

		<p>The nineteen year-old Armstrong hails from Church Hill, Tennessee, and moved to the Nashville area in 2020 to attend the award-winning music program at Middle Tennessee State University. He began his career in 2016 with the release of his single, “Praises,” and so began the subsequent release of several successful singles. Now, he’s embracing a new sound—and new influences on his album, "Is it Tomorrow?"</p>
		
		<p>There are many impressive aspects of Ahaz’s musical landscape, but what is perhaps most impressive is not his age, nor his versatility, but his acute musical precision. This record is thoughtful, spontaneous, whimsical, and wonderful, which is evident in both the lyrics and production of each track. Ahaz takes inspiration from all genres, and isn’t afraid to bend the rules associated with his particular brand of R&B infused pop. Influences like Gentle Giant and A Tribe Called Quest are easily heard in the production, while the lyrics feel reminiscent of songwriting icons like Elliott Smith and Kendrick Lamar.<p>
		
		<p>Ahaz isn’t just another copy, however. His music is truly an original, and a refreshingly honest portrayal of the universal young adult experience. His music can be found on all major digital music platforms.<p>
